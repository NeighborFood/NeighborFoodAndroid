# Summary for sprint 6

## Badis (scrum master)

## Elior
I got caught up by the time and could not implement everything I had to.
I had troubles with the login page because my computer was not recognized by the Google Auth. We will fix this soon.

Changing the workflow was good to make things better in my opinion but I could not stick to it as much as I would have wanted.
The next weeks will be better for me to work on the project.

I feel my time estimates are improving, it is really hard to know how much time a task will take but I understood that even really small looking tasks take at least few hours because I still have to learn.

## Khalil
I had quite some trouble having the tests work with the chosen architecture, so I decided to go with a different approach. 
At least now, the tests are now up and running, the feature of displaying the connected user works well, displaying the basic activities.
My time estimates are still a bit off, but they are getting better.

## Raed
I have added links to social media so now when you click on facebook/instagram/twitter you get redirected to the page on the browser.
And I fixed the problems with the vendor profile activity so now the profile looks good and past meals are there.
I reviewed the pull requests of khalil, yassine and Badis.
