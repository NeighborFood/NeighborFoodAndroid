# Summary for sprint 6

## Badis (scrum master)

## Elior

## Khalil
I had quite some trouble having the tests work with the chosen architecture, so I decided to go with a different approach. 
At least now, the tests are now up and running, the feature of displaying the connected user works well, displaying the basic activities.
My time estimates are still a bit off, but they are getting better.
