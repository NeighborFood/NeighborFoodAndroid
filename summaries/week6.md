# Summary for sprint 6

## Badis (scrum master)
I have worked on the VendorDashboard fragment which still had some errors that needed to be fixed before merging into the main branch. This included fixing things such as dependency issues caused by the FloatingActionButton and the fragment not integrating well with other relevant activities.

## Elior

## Khalil
I had quite some trouble having the tests work with the chosen architecture, so I decided to go with a different approach. 
At least now, the tests are now up and running, the feature of displaying the connected user works well, displaying the basic activities.
My time estimates are still a bit off, but they are getting better.

## Raed
I have added links to social media so now when you click on facebook/instagram/twitter you get redirected to the page on the browser.
And I fixed the problems with the vendor profile activity so now the profile looks good and past meals are there.
I reviewed the pull requests of khalil, yassine and Badis.
