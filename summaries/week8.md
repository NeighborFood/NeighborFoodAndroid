## Elior

## Khalil
For this week, I preferred to start working on refactoring the code based on the code reviews to have a cleaner code base, but my time estimate was a bit off and it took more time than expected which impacted the time I started working on the user repository. The feature is implemented, the tests are written but need some fixing.

## Raed 
I worked on creating the detailed Past Order when selected, I refactored my implemented classes and added links for the demo. I reviewed khalil and yassine.
