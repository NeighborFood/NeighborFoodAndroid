# Summary for sprint 8

## Badis
## Elior
I did not take time to work this week.
## Khalil
For this week, I preferred to start working on refactoring the code based on the code reviews to have a cleaner code base, but my time estimate was a bit off and it took more time than expected which impacted the time I started working on the user repository. The feature is implemented, the tests are written but need some fixing.
## Raed 
I worked on creating the detailed Past Order when selected, I refactored my implemented classes and added links for the demo. I reviewed khalil and yassine.
## Yassine (scrum master) 
I worked on implementing the databse and refractoring the already existing code for the models to take into account the code review. I staarted working on intgerating the cloud store for
the chat but wasn't able to finish.
## Overall team
The main issue this week is the time in whcih the prs are done: they are late and don't give much time for the reviewers before the meeting.
