# Summary for sprint 5

## Badis


## Elior

My time estimates were still off, I under estimated the time it would take me to implement properly the allergen display feature.
The tasks were not too hard but took me a lot of time.

One good point is that implementing this new feature was the opportunity to clean up the code a bit.

I did not have time to implement the feature exactly how I thought, neither to write extensive tests for it.
I have had a hard time with the code not passing the tests on Cirrus even though everything was good on my computer. I had to launch each tests on Cirrus at list a second time.

We moved the standup meeting exceptionnaly to Thursday but I could not attend it and neither could I attend the Sprint meeting of the end of this week.

I will pay a particular attention to estimate in a more accurate maneer the time tasks can take.


## Khalil
I spent a (lot!) of time reading documentation and I implemented the connection between the user that is logged in and the profile editing (see the picture and name of the current user connected) I also worked on displaying the conversations with the tabbed navigation.
I finally worked on the demo

## Raed
I implemented the Vendor Profile Activity where you can see the meal's vendor profile with his picture/name/bio/past meals/links to social Media..
I added a subscribe and notification buttons too in order to link them later to the database.And in this activity you can see details about vendor's rating and number of reviews and total meals posted.. that will be retrieved from the database later.
I reviewed elior's work too and worked with khalil on creating the demo for this week.

## Slim (scrum master)
I implemented the order History Activity where you can see the past orders of the logged in user, with the time where the order was achieved and details about the meal/Vendor.
I had too many bugs with android studio (with the emulator), I spent too much time debugging and waiting for the emulator to launch and I was not able to finish the testing part.

## Yassine
This week I worked on designing the DB.
Time estimates were OK.
I spent most of the time deciding the architecture and choosing the most suitable design patters for our case. I produced code and some tests ( the high level abstractions and the firestore implementation) but for some reason my build fails due to duplicate classes error. I spent a lot of time trying to fix it or go around it but I couldn’t so I wasn’t able to merge my work into main.
I reviewed the PR of Ellior, but I wasn't able to review the PR of Raed due to some weird behavior from github.
