# Summary for sprint 5

## Badis


## Elior

My time estimates were still off, I under estimated the time it would take me to implement properly the allergen display feature.
The tasks were not too hard but took me a lot of time.

One good point is that implementing this new feature was the opportunity to clean up the code a bit.

I did not have time to implement the feature exactly how I thought, neither to write extensive tests for it.
I have had a hard time with the code not passing the tests on Cirrus even though everything was good on my computer. I had to launch each tests on Cirrus at list a second time.

We moved the standup meeting exceptionnaly to Thursday but I could not attend it and neither could I attend the Sprint meeting of the end of this week.

I will pay a particular attention to estimate in a more accurate maneer the time tasks can take.
