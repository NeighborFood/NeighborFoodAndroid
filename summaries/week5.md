# Summary for sprint 5

## Badis


## Elior

My time estimates were still off, I under estimated the time it would take me to implement properly the allergen display feature.
The tasks were not too hard but took me a lot of time.

One good point is that implementing this new feature was the opportunity to clean up the code a bit.

I did not have time to implement the feature exactly how I thought, neither to write extensive tests for it.
I have had a hard time with the code not passing the tests on Cirrus even though everything was good on my computer. I had to launch each tests on Cirrus at list a second time.

We moved the standup meeting exceptionnaly to Thursday but I could not attend it and neither could I attend the Sprint meeting of the end of this week.

I will pay a particular attention to estimate in a more accurate maneer the time tasks can take.


## Khalil
I spent a (lot!) of time reading documentation and I implemented the connection between the user that is logged in and the profile editing (see the picture and name of the current user connected) I also worked on displaying the conversations with the tabbed navigation.
I finally worked on the demo

## Raed
I implemented the Vendor Profile Activity where you can see the meal's vendor profile with his picture/name/bio/past meals/links to social Media..
I added a subscribe and notification buttons too in order to link them later to the database.And in this activity you can see details about vendor's rating and number of reviews and total meals posted.. that will be retrieved from the database later.
I reviewed elior's work too.
