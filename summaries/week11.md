# Summary for sprint 10 2nd week

## Badis
## Elior
## Khalil

For this sprint, I worked on uploading the photos for the user profile and the meals and also fetching them. I also worked on showing details of the user on their vendor profile (with photos, name, links and number of subscribers)
This task also included making the subscription button functional (so that when you click on it you either get subscrirbed or unsubscribed)
I also worked on merging the feature of the chat, refactoring it to fit well with the rest of the code base and adding the missing functionalitites it lacked (like starting a conversation with a vendor)
Finally, I added the allergens upload on the database so that it reflects what the user chose when placing a meal.
This was a pretty big sprint full of tasks on different aspects of the app and there still remains a lot to do for the app to be fully functionnal.

## Raed(scrum master)
This week I tried to do as many tasks as possible besides to the ones I got assigned to. I implemented pushing the meal with its corresponding order to the db when placed
and I added more states to the orderStatus (order starts unassigned when posted then assigned when someone orders it then finshed when buyers confirms delivery). I reimplemented the
fetching of the meal list so that it corresponds to the new architecture and added the queries where you only get unassigned meal that you didn't post. I fetched the meal details from the database too.
I added some transitions between classes and many other small tasks. I worked on merging the two big branches together with khalil which took us a very long time.
