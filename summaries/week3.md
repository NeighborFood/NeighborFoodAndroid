# Summary for sprint 3

## Badis


## Elior  (Scrum Master)

I spent a lot of time trying to fix compilation bugs and ended once again not having the time to finish my tasks.
I have had trouble dedicating the time to the project early in the week but this is going to change since my other occupations are getting less intense.
