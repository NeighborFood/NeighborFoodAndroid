# Summary for sprint 3

## Badis


## Elior  (Scrum Master)

I spent a lot of time trying to fix compilation bugs and ended once again not having the time to finish my tasks.
I have had trouble dedicating the time to the project early in the week but this is going to change since my other occupations are getting less intense.


## Khalil
I refactored two actgivities into fragments and added a bottom navigation bar. I have not been able to finish all the tests as I had some trouble strating to test the fragments.

## Raed


## Slim


## Yassine
I implemented the UI for the chatrooms and started working on the abstractions and structure of the authentication and the database. The dask took much more time than expected So I wasn't able to write the tests


## Overall team
