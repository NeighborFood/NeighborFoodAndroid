# Summary for sprint 3

## Badis


## Elior  (Scrum Master)

I spent a lot of time trying to fix compilation bugs and ended once again not having the time to finish my tasks.
I have had trouble dedicating the time to the project early in the week but this is going to change since my other occupations are getting less intense.


## Khalil


## Raed


## Slim


## Yassine
I implemented the UI for the chatrooms and started working on the abstractions and structure of the authentication and the database. The dask took much more time than expected So I wasn't able to write the tests
