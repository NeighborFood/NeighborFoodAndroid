# Summary for sprint 3

## Badis


## Elior  (Scrum Master)

I spent a lot of time trying to fix compilation bugs and ended once again not having the time to finish my tasks.
I have had trouble dedicating the time to the project early in the week but this is going to change since my other occupations are getting less intense.


## Khalil
I refactored two actgivities into fragments and added a bottom navigation bar. I have not been able to finish all the tests as I had some trouble strating to test the fragments.

## Raed
-added a horizontal scrollable list of allergen icons where vendor can pick which allergens
his meal have(select and deselect).
-added meal date and time with making the date selectable from a calendar by clicking the calendar button
-wrote tests for both weeks (missing image uploading tests and finilising other tests)

## Slim
I refactored all the login part to make it a transparent interface. I updated the ui, But I have not been able to finish all the tests as the refactoring part took me much more time than expected.

## Yassine
I implemented the UI for the chatrooms and started working on the abstractions and structure of the authentication and the database. The dask took much more time than expected So I wasn't able to write the tests
