# Summary for sprint 7

## Badis
## Elior
I did not manage to spend enough time for the project during the dedicated week neither early in the holidays. I worked on completing the DummyDatabase function to have a testable behavior (not possible to test with Firebase) but the structure I was developing appears to not be adapted and the code base would be even worse if we merged it. The code feedback the assistant gave us confirmed this idea. I will implement a simpler version of DummyDatabase for testing purpose next week.

## Khalil
I worked on the feature of adding links dynamically to the user profile. Implementation went on smoothly, which allowed the time estimates to be accurate.
I also took care of fixing the build issues that we had after importing some libraries for the database. It was a bit time consuming but hopefully these kind of problems will be punctual.
