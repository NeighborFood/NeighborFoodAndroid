# Summary for sprint 7

## Badis
## Elior
## Khalil
I worked on the feature of adding links dynamically to the user profile. Implementation went on smoothly, which allowed the time estimates to be accurate.
I also took care of fixing the build issues that we had after importing some libraries for the database. It was a bit time consuming but hopefully these kind of problems will be punctual.
