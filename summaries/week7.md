# Summary for sprint 7

## Badis
worked on requesting location access and fetching gps location. for now the location is only displayed on the screen, but will later be used to filter/sort through meals. He faced problems with the build.
## Elior
I did not manage to spend enough time for the project during the dedicated week neither early in the holidays. I worked on completing the DummyDatabase function to have a testable behavior (not possible to test with Firebase) but the structure I was developing appears to not be adapted and the code base would be even worse if we merged it. The code feedback the assistant gave us confirmed this idea. I will implement a simpler version of DummyDatabase for testing purpose next week.

## Khalil
I worked on the feature of adding links dynamically to the user profile. Implementation went on smoothly, which allowed the time estimates to be accurate.
I also took care of fixing the build issues that we had after importing some libraries for the database. It was a bit time consuming but hopefully these kind of problems will be punctual.
## Raed (scrum master)
I have implemented the PastOrdersActivity where you have a list of past orders ( added the Order class) so that users can later access every Order's details  and I have reviewed khalil, yassine and Bedis.
## Yassine 
continued his work on the database and implemented the fetching and pushing the data to the database.

## Overall team
Overall every team member tried to fulfill his tasks, some of us faced some problems in implementing their features, but we had three meetings 2 prior to the Spring break and then on at its end to assign this week's tasks and discuss last sprint advancement.
