# Summary for sprint 9

## Badis
## Elior
## Khalil (scrum master) 
For this sprint, I implemented the notifications features, which notifies a user who is subscribed to another one when a new meal is posted. This task inclined implmenting the upload of meals feature, as well as the subscription feature. 
It was a pretty big task, but thankfully with the current architecture we have, the implementation was clean and pretty much straightforward. 
No issues were encountered on the app side but I had some problems setting up the serverside handling of notifications (firebase cloud functions).
I also couldn't implement the tests, there are some problems with testing asynchronous methods. We have to start using mockito as soon as possible.
## Raed 
For this sprint, I worked on the implementation feature with khalil, I handled displaying the notifcation and redirecting from it to the meal corresponding to it.
This week I faced some problems with retrieving the data (the notification informations is working with dummy values for now)from the database and couldn't test for the same reasons as Khalil.
## Yassine 
## Overall team
The main issue is still about PRs being made late, not giving much time for the reviews.
