# Summary for sprint 10 2nd week

## Badis
## Elior 
## Khalil
For this sprint, I worked on uploading the photos for the user profile and the meals and also fetching them. I also worked on showing details of the user on their vendor profile (with photos, name, links and number of subscribers)
This task also included making the subscription button functional (so that when you click on it you either get subscrirbed or unsubscribed)
I also worked on merging the feature of the chat, refactoring it to fit well with the rest of the code base and adding the missing functionalitites it lacked (like starting a conversation with a vendor)
Finally, I added the allergens upload on the database so that it reflects what the user chose when placing a meal.
This was a pretty big sprint full of tasks on different aspects of the app and there still remains a lot to do for the app to be fully functionnal.
