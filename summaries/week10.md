# Summary for sprint 10

## Badis
## Elior (scrum master)
I implemented the upload of the meal to the database and cleaned the way the Allergen were handled. I had issues with image and vendorId management.
Some interdependencies between our tasks prevented me to do some tasks (but I could have used fake data anyway!)

## Overall team
We still get to work too late in the week, with late PR and not enough time for good code review.
The database is being more and more used and the overall codebase starts to be more coherent!
We have problems regarding the schedule of meetings, which leads to late meetings with few time to react afterwards.
