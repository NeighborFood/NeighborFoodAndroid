# Summary for sprint 10 2nd week

## Badis
## Elior (scrum master)
## Khalil
## Raed
This week I tried to do as many tasks as possible besides to the ones I got assigned to. I implemented pushing the meal with its corresponding order to the db when placed 
and I added more states to the orderStatus (order starts unassigned when posted then assigned when someone orders it then finshed when buyers confirms delivery). I reimplemented the 
fetching of the meal list so that it corresponds to the new architecture and added the queries where you only get unassigned meal that you didn't post. I fetched the meal details from the database too. 
I added some transitions between classes and many other small tasks. I worked on merging the two big branches together with khalil which took us a very long time.
